title: About Me
---

My name is Kyle Burris and I am a third year PhD student in the department of Statistical Science at Duke University, currently advised by Dr. Peter Hoff.  I'm an avid sports fan who is passionate about statistics education, data science, and Bayesian statistics.    

This site serves as my personal webpage where I will periodically update readers on cool problems that I am working on and link to the webpages of courses and I am teaching/have taught.

If you are interested in knowing more about me or have comments about what you see here, feel free to [send me an email!](mailto:kyle.burris@duke.edu)
