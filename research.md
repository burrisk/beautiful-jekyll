I have broad research interests in applied Bayesian analysis.  Below are some research projects that I am currently working on.

### Sensorimotor Assessments of Professional Baseball Players
One project that I am working on involves identifying the relationship between sensorimotor ability (as measured by a proprietary Nike assessment battery) and on-field performance in professional baseball.  This presents some unique modeling challenges, since player comparison is tricky between multiple professional baseball leagues

### Bayesian Exploitative Strategies in Imperfect Information Games
After repeated interactions with an adversary, an agent (Hero) can often infer the strategy of an opponent (Villain) based on observing prior action.  If Villain does not play an equilibrium strategy, Hero can sometimes deviate from the equilibrium to play a nemesis strategy that improves payoffs.  Through adversarial modeling and Bayesian inference, I'm developing an approach for Hero to exploit Villain's tendencies, incorporating uncertainty both the model and Villain's hidden information.

### Edit-Imputation of Continuous Microdata
Large, cross-sectional business surveys are often riddled with missing and/or erroneous values.  In my research, I extend and develop methodology to simultaneously flag erroneous values and impute them, when the imputed values are necessarily constrained to a polytope.

### Baseball Hackathons
I love the game of baseball and how it lends itself to insightful data collection and analysis.  This past year, I won the 2017 TruMedia Hackathon, which was judged by 13 baseball executives.  My winning submission can be found [here](https://github.com/burrisk/TruMedia2017/blob/master/Write-Ups/Hackathon_Burris.pdf)

### Zillow Housing Competition
On May 24, 2017, Zillow announced a crowdsourced [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1) to develop a model for housing prices, starting with modeling the drawbacks of the current Zestimate and concluding with a complete model for all houses in America.  This seems like an excellent data set that incorporates both time series and spatial information.  I'm looking forward to being a part of this competition.
