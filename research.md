I have broad research interests in statistics and data analysis, particularly in baseball applications.  Below are some research projects that I am currently working on.

## Statistical Methodology

#### Adaptive procedures for multiple testing and post-selection inference
Science is currently facing a replication crisis, in which many scientific findings cannot be replicated in follow-up studies.  I think that much of this problem is due to the improper use of statistical methods in determining statistical significance, since models are often selected after analyzing the data.  Multiple testing procedures and post-selection inference provide a way forward for researchers who want to prevent false positives, while still letting the model be determined by the data.

#### Exact adaptive confidence intervals for small area inference
In sample surveys, researchers are often interested in estimating an area mean or total.  However, traditional confidence interval methods can be too imprecise when the sample size is large.  I'm working on developing a framework to adaptively construct confidence intervals with constant coverage, borrowing information across areas and/or time periods.

## Baseball
#### Sensorimotor assessments of professional baseball players
One project that I am working on involves identifying the relationship between sensorimotor ability (as measured by a proprietary Nike assessment battery) and on-field performance in professional baseball, in collaboration with researchers in the department of Psychiatry at Duke.  You can find the paper, published in Nature Scientific Reports [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-18565-7).  The study has been featured outlets such as [FanGraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/neuroscience-can-project-batting-lines-now/) and [US News](https://health.usnews.com/health-care/articles/2018-01-17/for-baseball-scouts-another-tool-for-spotting-talent).  I will be presenting this work at the [2018 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/).

#### Quantifying fatigue in MLB relievers
As relief pitcher usage has become a hot topic in recent years, making optimal bullpen decision has become increasingly important. I [develop a framework](files/relief_fatigue) borrowed from toxicology to predict velocity loss as a result of a pitcher's recent appearances.


#### A context-dependent metric for batter plate discipline
Although a lot of factors go into a batter's decision of whether to swing, the best publicly available metrics for plate discipline only use a binary indicator for whether the pitch was inside the strike zone to judge a batter's plate discipline.  I believe that we can do much better by looking at the context of the pitch to determine the relative advantage of swinging.
