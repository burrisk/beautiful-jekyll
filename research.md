I have broad research interests in statistics and data analysis.  Below are some research projects that I am currently working on.

### Exact Adaptive Confidence Intervals for Areal Spatial Data
When analyzing spatial data, a key feature is that measurements at one location are often more similar to measurements taken at a nearby location than those from a location farther away.  Constructing confidence intervals using data only in a particular area can be inefficient, since doing so fails to take the information from nearby areas into account. However, credible intervals derived from Bayesian hierarchical spatial models based on prior information do not get guaranteed coverage for each location.  In my work, I'm developing methodology for constructing confidence intervals for the areal means of continuous random variables, potentially extending the approach to count data.

### Sensorimotor Assessments of Professional Baseball Players
One project that I am working on involves identifying the relationship between sensorimotor ability (as measured by a proprietary Nike assessment battery) and on-field performance in professional baseball.  This presents some unique modeling challenges, since player comparison is tricky between multiple professional baseball leagues

### Bayesian Exploitative Strategies in Imperfect Information Games
After repeated interactions with an adversary, an agent (Hero) can often infer the strategy of an opponent (Villain) based on observing prior action.  If Villain does not play an equilibrium strategy, Hero can sometimes deviate from the equilibrium to play a nemesis strategy that improves payoffs.  Through adversarial modeling and Bayesian inference, I'm developing an approach for Hero to exploit Villain's tendencies, incorporating uncertainty both the model and Villain's hidden information.

### Edit-Imputation of Continuous Microdata
Large, cross-sectional business surveys are often riddled with missing and/or erroneous values. I've worked on extending methodology to simultaneously flag erroneous values and impute them, when the imputed values are necessarily constrained to a polytope.

### Baseball Hackathons
I love the game of baseball and how it lends itself to insightful data collection and analysis.  This past year, I won the 2017 TruMedia Hackathon, which was judged by 13 baseball executives.  My winning submission can be found [here](https://github.com/burrisk/TruMedia2017/blob/master/Write-Ups/Hackathon_Burris.pdf)
